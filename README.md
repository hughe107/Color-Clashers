# Color-Clashers
Final Project for CS252-Systems Programming. This was completed with a peer in the class using JavaScript, HTML5, SQL, and Node.js. 
The program is a web based, 4 player, game created through Bluemix.net which no longer has the server running for the game.
It is a game of 4 players starting in a simple rectangular arena. The players try to shoot little pellets at one another to deplete all of the others health bars. In each corner is a colored power up that altered the players color and the type of projectile they fired.
